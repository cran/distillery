Author: Eric Gilleland
Maintainer: Eric Gilleland <ericg@ucar.edu>
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0)
Description: Some very simple method functions for confidence interval calculation, bootstrap resampling aimed at atmospheric science applications, and to distill pertinent information from a potentially complex object; primarily used in common with packages extRemes and SpatialVx.  To reference this package and for a tutorial on the bootstrap functions, please see Gilleland (2020) <doi: 10.1175/JTECH-D-20-0069.1> and Gilleland (2020) <doi: 10.1175/JTECH-D-20-0070.1>.
